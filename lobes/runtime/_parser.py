"""Infer the OpenAI ``--tool-call-parser`` to use for a given model.

vLLM needs a tool-call parser that matches how the served model emits tool
calls. Picking the wrong one silently breaks tool calling (the server returns
200 but no usable ``tool_calls``), so ``lobes switch`` auto-selects one per model
rather than leaving the caller to remember it. The rules below mirror the
guidance in ``templates/env.example`` (the single source of truth):

* Qwen3-Coder / Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6 checkpoints emit the XML function format → ``qwen3_coder``
* Qwen3 dense models emit Hermes-style JSON tool calls → ``hermes``
* Mistral checkpoints emit the ``[TOOL_CALLS]`` format → ``mistral``
* anything else → ``None`` (unknown; leave the configured parser untouched and
  let the caller pass ``--tool-call-parser`` explicitly)

The Qwen3 markers are deliberately **Qwen3-scoped** — a bare ``coder`` would also
match unrelated checkpoints (``deepseek-coder``, ``codellama``, ``Qwen2.5-Coder``)
and silently misconfigure their parser, so the coder rule requires the ``qwen3``
family. The ``mistral`` marker matches the Mistral family — note the common
``mistralai/`` org prefix contains the substring, so ``mistralai/Mixtral-…`` and
``mistralai/Ministral-…`` resolve to ``mistral`` too (correct: they share the
``[TOOL_CALLS]`` format). A bare ``mixtral``/``ministral`` basename without that
prefix does not match. Anything we haven't validated returns ``None`` (safe).

Pure string matching — no network, no model download. Extend ``_RULES`` to teach
a new family.
