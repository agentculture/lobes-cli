# lobes

lobes is the tooling that **runs, assesses, and switches** the local,
OpenAI-compatible vLLM model the Culture mesh consumes. The binary is `lobes`
(with `model` kept as a deprecated alias).

The served model is what the **lobes** agent connects to over the acp
`vllm-local` provider — the same lobes runs the engine and consumes it (the
tool and the deployed agent share one identity).

## Verbs

- `lobes init [TARGET]` — scaffold a deployment dir (default `~/.lobes`).
  Dry-run by default; `--apply` writes, `--force` overwrites.
- `lobes serve` (alias `start`) / `lobes stop` — start / stop the vLLM server.
  Dry-run by default; `--apply` to commit.
- `lobes switch <model>` — switch the served model. Dry-run by default;
  `--apply` recreates the container and waits for `/health`.
- `lobes fleet up|down|status` — drive the gateway fleet (one OpenAI front over
  the generate primary plus co-resident embedding + reranker gears, routed by task
  family; a generate fallback is opt-in). Scaffold it with `lobes init --fleet`.
  `up`/`down` are dry-run by default; `--apply` to commit.
- `lobes tunnel` — expose the local API at a public hostname via a Cloudflare
  Tunnel (`--stop` to tear down). Dry-run by default; `--apply` to commit.
- `lobes status` — read-only: the configured served model (from `.env`), container
  state, `/health`. (For the full set you can switch to, use `lobes overview --list`;
  for what's actually loaded now, the live `/v1/models`.)
- `lobes assess` — read-only correctness probes + reasoning-trace detection.
- `lobes benchmark` — read-only decode throughput + prefill latency.
- `lobes overview` — snapshot of the tool, the served model, and the supported
  catalog (the gears you can switch to). `--current` = configured served model;
  `--list` = catalog.
- `lobes whoami` — tool, machine, served model, container health.
- `lobes doctor` — diagnose docker / compose / `.env` / health.

## Mutation safety

Write verbs (`switch`, `serve`, `stop`, `init`, `tunnel`, `fleet up`/`fleet down`)
are **dry-run by default** and require `--apply` to commit. The rest are read-only.

## Exit-code policy

- `0` success
- `1` user-input error (bad flag, bad path, missing arg)
- `2` environment / setup error (docker missing, `.env` unreadable, endpoint down)
- `3+` reserved

_SWITCH = """\
# lobes switch

`lobes switch <model>` changes which vLLM model is served. **Dry-run by
default** (prints the plan, changes nothing); `--apply` commits.

On `--apply` it resolves a serve config from three layers — the **machine**
profile (`--machine`, default auto-detected), the **workload** profile
(`--purpose`, default `balanced`), and the model's catalog entry (quantization,
tool parser) — and writes the `VLLM_*` vars to the deployment `.env` —

```text
VLLM_MODEL, VLLM_SERVED_NAME, VLLM_PORT, VLLM_PURPOSE, VLLM_MACHINE,
VLLM_MAX_MODEL_LEN, VLLM_GPU_MEM_UTIL, VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND,
VLLM_MAX_NUM_SEQS, VLLM_MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS
(+ VLLM_TOOL_CALL_PARSER / VLLM_QUANTIZATION for a known/overridden model)
```

— then recreates the container (`docker compose down && up -d`) and waits for
`/health` (the first run downloads weights, so this can take many minutes).

Flags: `--port`, `--purpose {balanced,prompt-heavy,decode-heavy}` (tunes batching
+ the benchmark shape), `--machine {auto,spark,thor,blackwell,generic}` (GPU mem /
context / attention defaults), `--max-model-len` / `--gpu-mem-util` (explicit
overrides of the machine profile), `--served-name`, `--tool-call-parser` (e.g.
`hermes` for Qwen3 dense, `qwen3_coder` for Qwen3-Coder/3.6), `--quantization`,
`--compose-dir`, `--apply`, `--json`. Switching to a model with catalog serve-extras
prints a reminder for the compose-only flags that can't be defaulted in the shared
template: the Qwen3.6-35B-A3B MoE wants `--moe-backend=marlin` (its MTP
speculative-config is *not* carried — it fails to load on that checkpoint), and the
`sakamakismile/Qwen3.6-27B-Text-NVFP4-MTP` candidate carries an MTP
`--speculative-config` (plus `--trust-remote-code` / `--language-model-only`).
Only one ~30B-class model fits on a single GB10 at a time, so the switch frees
the prior model before starting the new one.

plus host-side facts (image tag, GPU memory). Throughput lives in
`lobes benchmark`. Supports `--json`.

_BACKEND = """\
# lobes backend

lobes runs a **local vLLM server** that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API.
The Culture `acp` backend (opencode's `vllm-local` provider) connects to it —
this is the model the **lobes** agent consumes.

## Deployment

`docker-compose.yml` runs the NGC vLLM image (`nvcr.io/nvidia/vllm:26.04-py3`)
as the `model-gear-vllm` container. `lobes init` scaffolds it into
`~/.lobes`; `lobes serve` brings it up. Key serve flags:

```text
--quantization=modelopt_fp4   # nvidia/ checkpoints are ModelOpt FP4
--kv-cache-dtype=fp8
--reasoning-parser=qwen3      # expose the <think> trace
--enable-auto-tool-choice     # OpenAI tool/function calling (tool_choice:"auto")
--tool-call-parser=hermes     # VLLM_TOOL_CALL_PARSER; qwen3_coder for Qwen3-Coder/3.6
--enable-prefix-caching
```

Tuned for DGX Spark (GB10 Grace Blackwell, 128 GB unified memory) via
`VLLM_GPU_MEM_UTIL` (default 0.6) and `VLLM_MAX_MODEL_LEN` (default 262144).

## The must-match invariant

`VLLM_SERVED_NAME` in `.env` **must equal** the part after `vllm-local/` in
the `culture.yaml` `model:` field, or the acp provider won't resolve the
model. `lobes doctor` checks this.
"""

_MODELS = """\
# lobes models

Per-model notes live under `docs/` — one markdown file per model that has been
run on this hardware, holding the correctness + throughput numbers produced by
`lobes assess` and `lobes benchmark`.

- `docs/qwen3.6-27b-text-nvfp4-mtp.md` — `sakamakismile/Qwen3.6-27B-Text-NVFP4-MTP`,
  the fleet's **default primary** (promoted 2026-05-31): the 27B re-exported with its
  MTP draft head restored so vLLM speculative decoding works (the baseline NVFP4
  export drops it). Text-only; its MTP serve flags are baked into the compose
  template. Load-tested on the GB10: ~18.7-19.1 tok/s decode (~2.4x the archived
  baseline 27B) at ~72-79% MTP acceptance, tool calling + reasoning verified (#26).
- `docs/qwen3.6-27b-nvfp4.md` — `mmangkad/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4`, the **archived** former
  primary (hybrid Mamba/linear-attn + ViT, 256K native). Retained as the MTP
  primary's tokenizer source and the only vision-capable 27B.
- `docs/mistral-small-3.2-24b-nvfp4.md` — `RedHatAI/Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Instruct-2506-NVFP4`,
  a dense **warm-fallback candidate**. It was the default fleet fallback until the
  single-backend default removed it (the fleet runs one *generate* backend by
  default); wire it back via the opt-in `FALLBACK_*` config. Loads reliably on the
  GB10; serve with the mistral tokenizer + images disabled (required for tool-call
  parsing on this build; see the doc).
- `docs/qwen3-32b-nvfp4.md` — `nvidia/Qwen3-32B-NVFP4`, a dense candidate (faster
  decode; swap in via `PRIMARY_MODEL` / `lobes switch`).
- `docs/qwen3.6-35b-a3b-nvfp4.md` — `mmangkad/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4`, a MoE
  candidate (the former fallback; OOM'd/stalled on the GB10, never load-tested).
- `docs/qwen3-embedding-0.6b.md` — `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`, the **embedding
  gear**: 0.6B dense text embedder, 1024-dim (Matryoshka-truncatable), 32K context,
  served via `/v1/embeddings` (`--runner pooling --convert embed`). Warm fleet
  backend — co-resident with the 27B primary on the GB10.
- `docs/qwen3-reranker-0.6b.md` — `Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B`, the **reranker
  gear**: 0.6B cross-encoder, served via `/v1/rerank` + `/v1/score`
  (`--runner pooling --convert classify`). Same backend handles both endpoints.
  Warm fleet backend — co-resident on the GB10.

These models *are* the **supported catalog** — the gears you can switch to, each
tagged `load-tested` (proven on this box) or `configured` (declared, not yet
proven). It is static (defined in `lobes/catalog.py`, shipped in the wheel).
Read it with `lobes overview --list` or the gateway's `GET /v1/models/supported`;
it flags which one is currently served.

For what is *loaded right now* (in GPU memory this instant) use the live
`/v1/models` (which `lobes fleet status` queries) — that is runtime truth, not the
catalog. (`lobes status` / `lobes whoami` report the *configured* served model from
`.env` + health, not a live list.) Mnemonic: the catalog is what's on the menu;
`/v1/models` is what's hot now. See `lobes explain gateway` for the endpoint split,
and `lobes explain fleet` to run two side-by-side behind one OpenAI endpoint.
"""

_FLEET = """\
# lobes fleet

The fleet runs the **always-warm Qwen primary plus co-resident embedding and
reranker gears behind one OpenAI-compatible gateway**, managed as four containers
by default: `model-gear-vllm-primary`, `model-gear-vllm-embed`,
`model-gear-vllm-rerank`, and `model-gear-gateway` (a warm *generate* fallback,
`model-gear-vllm-fallback`, is opt-in). The gateway routes each request to the
right backend by task family (generate / embed / score / rerank). Scaffold it
with `lobes init --fleet` (writes the fleet `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, and
`Dockerfile.gateway`), then:

- `lobes fleet up` — `docker compose up -d --build` (builds the gateway image),
  then waits for the gateway `/health`. The vLLM backend loads in the background.
- `lobes fleet down` — `docker compose down`.
- `lobes fleet status` — read-only: each container's state, the gateway `/health`,
  and the routed model list (`/v1/models`).

`up`/`down` are **dry-run by default**; pass `--apply` to commit. `--compose-dir`
overrides the deployment dir. There is **one generate backend** by default, so the
primary runs at its solo headroom (`PRIMARY_GPU_MEM_UTIL=0.6`, full 256K); the
embedding + reranker gears are ~0.6B (`*_GPU_MEM_UTIL=0.06` each), so they
co-reside without crowding it. If you add a warm *generate* fallback, set
`PRIMARY_GPU_MEM_UTIL` + `FALLBACK_GPU_MEM_UTIL` to sum well under 1.0 (they share
the 128 GB unified memory).

Note: `lobes switch` does **not** drive the fleet (it rewrites the single-model
`VLLM_*` keys). Change the fleet primary by editing the fleet `.env` and
re-running `lobes fleet up --apply`. See `lobes explain gateway` for routing.
"""

_GATEWAY = """\
# lobes gateway

The gateway is a stdlib (no third-party deps) OpenAI-compatible reverse proxy
that fronts the fleet's vLLM backend(s) on one port — the host port the acp
`vllm-local` provider already expects. It runs as the `model-gear-gateway`
container (`python -m lobes.gateway`).

## Routing

- **By name** — a request's `model` field routes to the backend that serves it
  (plus any `GATEWAY_ALIASES`). The forwarded body's `model` is rewritten to the
  backend's `--served-model-name` so the backend accepts it.
- **Default** — a missing or unknown `model` routes to `GATEWAY_DEFAULT_MODEL`
  (the primary), so existing single-model clients keep working unchanged.
- **Failover** — if the chosen backend refuses the connection or returns a 5xx
  **before any response body**, the gateway retries the request against the other
  backend. A 4xx (client error) is returned verbatim — no failover. Once a 2xx
  body starts streaming, there is no retry. SSE streams (`"stream": true`) are
  relayed chunk-by-chunk with per-chunk flushing.

## Pressure (busy backpressure)

Under swap/iowait pressure the gateway **sheds** a full-tier request
(`main`/`cortex` or `multimodal`/`senses`) with **HTTP 429 + `Retry-After`** and
`X-Lobes-Tier-Reason: busy` — it never substitutes a cheaper or
different-capability model in its place (issue #85). An explicit `model=minor`
request is the floor and is always served. There is no silent degrade and no
`LOBES_PRESSURE_POLICY` toggle. The `429` (`type: server_busy`) is distinct from
the hard `502` (`type: upstream_unavailable`, all backends down); clients must
honour `429` + `Retry-After` and retry with backoff. `X-Lobes-Override: true`
forces the requested tier (served, not shed). `lobes status --pressure` and the
gateway `GET /status` (`pressure` block) report the current busy state.

## Endpoints

- `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions` — chat and completion requests;
  routed to the primary (or fallback, if configured) by `model` field.
- `/v1/embeddings` — dense text embeddings; served by the warm
  **Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B** fleet backend, routed by `model` field
  (`"model": "Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B"`).
- `/v1/rerank` — Jina/Cohere-compatible re-ranking; served by the warm
  **Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B** fleet backend, routed by `model` field.
- `/v1/score` — vLLM cross-encoder raw scoring; same warm **Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B**
  backend as `/v1/rerank`, routed by `model` field.
- `/v1/models` — OpenAI-standard model list (lists all loaded backends).
- `/v1/models/supported` — the full supported-model catalog (every gear you can
  switch to, each flagged `loaded` / `default`).
- `/health` — gateway liveness check.

All endpoints are reached at the same gateway port — routing is by the request's
`model` field. Configured via the `gateway` service's environment in the fleet
compose (`PRIMARY_URL` / `FALLBACK_URL` / `*_SERVED_NAME` / `GATEWAY_DEFAULT_MODEL`
/ `GATEWAY_ALIASES` / timeouts).

## Auth (known limitation)

The gateway is a **pass-through** — it does not inspect or validate `Authorization`
headers. `CULTURE_VLLM_API_KEY` is enforced by vLLM on the single-model `lobes
serve` path, **not** by the gateway, so the fleet's proxied endpoints (generate /
embed / rerank / `/v1/audio/*`) are not bearer-gated. Keep the port private; layer
Cloudflare Access or an IP allowlist when exposing it via `lobes tunnel`.
Per-endpoint gateway auth is planned. See `lobes explain tunnel`.
"""

_TUNNEL = """\
# lobes tunnel

`lobes tunnel` exposes the local OpenAI-compatible vLLM API (`127.0.0.1:8000`) at
an owner-chosen public hostname through a **Cloudflare Tunnel**, so Culture agents
can call it from anywhere as an ordinary provider (`base_url` + `api_key`).
**Dry-run by default** (prints the exact `cloudflared` command — plaintext tokens
redacted — and the public `https://<host>/v1` URL); `--apply` starts a standalone
`cloudflared tunnel run` in the background (logging to `cloudflared.log` in the
deployment dir), and `--stop --apply` terminates it.

## Config (never committed)

- **Hostname** — `--hostname`, else `$CULTURE_VLLM_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME`, else
  `CULTURE_VLLM_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` in the gitignored `.cf-tunnel.env` (deployment dir).
- **Run-token** — from `.cf-tunnel.env`: `CULTURE_CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN_SHUSHU` (a
  shushu-sealed secret name, preferred) or `CULTURE_CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN` (plaintext
  fallback). `lobes init` scaffolds `cf-tunnel.env.example`; copy it to
  `.cf-tunnel.env` and edit.

## Two-step flow

1. **Cloudflare side, once** — the sibling `cultureflare` tool provisions the
   tunnel + ingress + DNS and seals the run-token:
   `cultureflare remote-login setup --hostname <host> --service http://127.0.0.1:8000
   --no-access --shushu --apply`.
2. **Local side** — `lobes serve --apply` (with `CULTURE_VLLM_API_KEY` set in
   `.env` so the API is bearer-gated) then `lobes tunnel --apply`.

`--apply` preflights that `cloudflared` (and `shushu`, for the sealed token) is on
PATH and that the local server answers `/health` first. **Set `CULTURE_VLLM_API_KEY`
before exposing the API** — without it the tunnel publishes an unauthenticated model.

**Single-model vs. fleet:** vLLM enforces `CULTURE_VLLM_API_KEY` on the `lobes
serve` (single-model) path. The **fleet gateway is a pass-through and is not
auth-aware**, so tunnelling the fleet does *not* bearer-protect its endpoints — add
Cloudflare Access or an IP allowlist for that case. See `lobes explain gateway`.

See `lobes explain backend` and the README "Expose the API" section.

`POST /v1/embeddings` — OpenAI-compatible text embeddings served by the warm

## Request

```json
{
  "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B",
  "input": ["text a", "text b"]
}
```

`input` accepts a string or a list of strings. The served name `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`
is the catalog id — the gateway routes to this backend by matching the `model` field.

Optional: `"dimensions": 512` — truncate the output embedding to any Matryoshka
sub-dimension (32 / 64 / 128 / 256 / 512 / 768 / 1024). Enabled via the
`--hf-overrides '{"is_matryoshka": true, "matryoshka_dimensions": [...]}'` serve flag.
Omit to get the native **1024-dim** output.

## Response

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {"object": "embedding", "index": 0, "embedding": [/* 1024 floats */]},
    {"object": "embedding", "index": 1, "embedding": [/* 1024 floats */]}
  ],
  "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B",
  "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4, "total_tokens": 4}
}
```

## Key facts

- **Dimension:** 1024 (native); request `"dimensions": N` for Matryoshka truncation.
- **Context:** 32K native, served at `--max-model-len 8192` (tiny KV footprint).
- **Serving:** `--runner pooling --convert embed` (vLLM pooling mode, not a chat
  model; this build's replacement for the old `--task embed`).
- **Served name == catalog id:** `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`.
- **Warm fleet backend:** co-resident with the 27B primary on the GB10; its small
  `--max-model-len` keeps the KV footprint tiny so all three backends (primary +
  embedder + reranker) co-fit in 128 GB unified memory.
- **Gateway port:** same port as chat — the gateway routes by `model` field.
- **No quantization flag, no tool parser** — pooling model, not a chat model.

## Key facts

- **Shape:** Jina / Cohere `/v1/rerank` — sorted by relevance, best-first.
- **Backend:** `Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B` with `--runner pooling --convert classify`
  (cross-encoder via the `Qwen3ForSequenceClassification` hf-override).
- **Rerank + score share one backend** — `/v1/rerank` and `/v1/score` both route
  to the same running container; `/v1/rerank` applies the Jina/Cohere sort + shape.
- **Context:** 32K native, served at `--max-model-len 8192`.
- **Warm fleet backend:** co-resident on the GB10; tiny KV footprint (0.6B, 32K window).
- **Gateway port:** same port as chat — routed by `model` field.

# lobes explain score

`POST /v1/score` — OpenAI / vLLM cross-encoder scoring served by the warm
**Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B** fleet backend (same backend as `/v1/rerank` — vLLM
`--runner pooling --convert classify`), routed by model name through the gateway.

## Request

```json

`text_1` is the query string; `text_2` is a string or list of strings (the passages

_TUNING = """\
# lobes tuning — purpose + machine profiles

`lobes switch` resolves the serve config from three layers (explicit flags win):

1. **machine** (`--machine`, default auto-detected from nvidia-smi + hostname) →
   `VLLM_GPU_MEM_UTIL`, `VLLM_MAX_MODEL_LEN`, `VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND`.
   `spark` 0.6/262144 (shared GB10), `blackwell` 0.85/65536 (dedicated VRAM),
   `thor` 0.6/32768, `generic` 0.6/32768. spark is load-tested; the rest are
   configured estimates.
2. **purpose** (`--purpose`, default `balanced`) → `VLLM_MAX_NUM_SEQS`,
   `VLLM_MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS`, and the shape `lobes benchmark` exercises:
   `balanced` 4/8192 (≈1K in/1K out), `prompt-heavy` 4/16384 (≈8K in/1K out),
   `decode-heavy` 8/4096 (≈1K in/8K out).
3. **model** (the catalog) → `VLLM_QUANTIZATION`, `VLLM_TOOL_CALL_PARSER`, and a
   printed reminder for any compose-only serve-extras (can't be defaulted in the
   shared template): `--moe-backend=marlin` for the MoE candidate (whose own MTP
   speculative-config is not carried — it fails to load on that checkpoint), and the
   MTP `--speculative-config` for the `sakamakismile/Qwen3.6-27B-Text-NVFP4-MTP`
   candidate (plus its `--trust-remote-code` / `--language-model-only`).

`lobes benchmark` defaults its workload shape to the configured `VLLM_PURPOSE`, so
the numbers track the serve config. Override with `--purpose` / `--input-len` /
`--output-len`. The throughput flags follow shahizat's cross-machine NVFP4
benchmark — see `docs/tuning-profiles.md`.
"""

_PROFILES = """\
# lobes profiles — machine detection and per-role tuning

A **machine profile** is a per-card tuning declaration: which models serve each
role (`cortex` / `senses` / `embedder` / `reranker`), their GPU memory budget,
context length, attention backend, and vLLM knobs the compose template
substitutes.

## Detection

When `lobes init` or `lobes serve` runs, card detection gathers facts from the
host (device name via `nvidia-smi`, compute capability, total memory from
`/proc/meminfo`, hostname, Jetson device-tree model) and resolves them via the
live `lobes.machines` registry (one `CardStrategy` per supported chip). An
`UNKNOWN` result is honest and first-class — no guessing or silent fallback.

## Profile resolution

Once detection (or an explicit `--machine` / `--profile` flag) resolves the card
name, a profile is looked up: explicit `--profile` wins, then operator-defined
files in `<deploy-dir>/profiles/<name>.toml`, then packaged built-ins.

Built-in profiles:
- `spark` — DGX Spark (GB10 Grace Blackwell, 128 GB unified), load-tested.
- `thor` — Jetson AGX Thor (Blackwell-class sm_110, 128 GB unified), load-tested
  with four validated divergences from Spark (kv_cache_dtype, attention backend,
  enforce_eager for reranker).
- `base` — conservative fallback for UNKNOWN cards (small 4B model, no
  multimodal).

## Knobs per role

Each of the four roles (cortex, senses, embedder, reranker) carries seven tunable
knobs (each optional — "no opinion" = template default applies):
`feasible`, `model`, `gpu_mem_util`, `max_model_len`, `quantization`,
`kv_cache_dtype`, `attention_backend`, `enforce_eager`, `max_num_seqs`.

Render to env vars via role→prefix (e.g., `cortex` → `PRIMARY_`), so
`cortex.gpu_mem_util=0.30` → `PRIMARY_GPU_MEM_UTIL=0.30`.

## Thor's validated divergences (2026-07-13)

All four Thor correctness probes pass with these measured knobs:
- `cortex kv_cache_dtype=auto` — not `fp8` (uncalibrated scale on this
  checkpoint/board pairing; issue #109).
- `senses/embedder/reranker attention_backend=TRITON_ATTN` — not FlashInfer
  (pooling path hangs on sm_110; issue #105).
- `reranker enforce_eager=true` — CUDA-graph capture is unstable on sm_110
  (crashes with `cudaErrorLaunchFailure` without it; issue #105).

## Custom profiles

Operator-defined profiles go in `<deploy-dir>/profiles/<name>.toml`. They are
fully self-contained (not merged with built-ins); any knob/role omitted means
"no opinion" (template default applies).

```toml
name = "my-box"
summary = "Custom RTX 6000"

[roles.cortex]
feasible = true
model = "sakamakismile/Qwen3.6-27B-Text-NVFP4-MTP"
gpu_mem_util = 0.75
max_model_len = 180000
```

Auto-detection only works if the detected machine name matches the profile name.
For new hardware, add a `CardStrategy` module to `lobes/machines/` (follow the
`spark.py` / `thor.py` pattern).

## Goldens contract

CI guards cross-machine safety via golden `.env` files (one per built-in
profile). Editing a machine strategy or profile code requires:
`uv run python tests/goldens/regen.py` (committed, diff'd by CI).

The invariant: editing the `thor` profile must not change the spark golden.

_SHAPES = """\
# lobes shapes — which lobes a box hosts

A **deployment shape** is the axis orthogonal to the machine profile: not
"how is each role tuned on this card?" (that's the profile, `lobes explain
profiles`) but "which of the six Colleague roles does this box host at
all?" A shape composes as pure data over the resolved card profile at
render time — `shape × card` — never a per-shape code fork.

## The four built-in shapes

- **`machine-as-brain`** (the default) — hosts every role the card can
  serve, today's behaviour made explicit. Carries zero overrides, so a bare
  `lobes init` (no `--shape`) renders byte-identically to before this flag
  existed.
- **`spark-lobe`** — drops `senses` (Gemma), keeps `cortex` + `embedder` +
  `reranker` + `stt`/`tts`. Reclaims the dropped budget: `cortex` rises to
  `gpu_mem_util=0.44` / `max_model_len=262144` (its full native 256K).
  Validated live on the DGX Spark GB10 (2026-07-14): measured KV pool
  888,946 tokens, 3.39× concurrency at the full 256K request.
- **`thor-lobe`** — drops `cortex` (Qwen), keeps `senses` + `embedder` +
  `reranker` + `stt`/`tts`. Reclaims the dropped budget: `senses` rises to
  `gpu_mem_util=0.30` / `max_model_len=131072` (its full native 128K).
  Validated live on the Jetson AGX Thor (2026-07-14): measured KV pool
  1,418,554 tokens, 10.82× concurrency at 131072.
- **`orin-small`** — drops BOTH `cortex` and `senses`, keeps the opt-in
  `minor` gear (`vllm-minor`) + `embedder` + `reranker` + `stt`/`tts`. The
  Jetson AGX Orin 64GB reference shape (mesh-brain end-state, issue #112,
  t2). **Declared, UNVALIDATED** — pure TOML + goldens only, no physical
  Orin has booted this shape (mirrors `base.toml`'s own conservative
  unrecognised-card fallback). No overrides (`minor` carries no Profile
  knobs to re-derive).

Both mesh-lobe shapes' reclaim values are **measured**, not computed: a
naive reclaim-sum or the model's own solo default was refused by vLLM on
the live box (unified memory is shared with the host), so the shipped TOML
carries the value that fit, with a provenance comment.

## Selecting a shape

```bash
lobes init --shape <machine-as-brain|spark-lobe|thor-lobe|orin-small> [--apply]
```

Dry-run by default (prints the resolved profile, the shape's `hosts` list,
and the env/override plan); `--apply` commits. Re-running with the previous
shape restores the previous rendering byte-for-byte. `--shape` is
incompatible with `--single` (the legacy topology has no profile/shape
resolution at all); it composes freely with `--audio` (every built-in shape
hosts `stt`/`tts` identically).

## Dropped-lobe honesty, end-to-end

A mesh shape's dropped core role never half-serves: the generated
`docker-compose.shape.yml` override parks its service in the inert
`shape-dropped` compose profile (requires Docker Compose v2.24+ for the
`!reset` merge tag on the gateway's `depends_on`) so it never runs;
`lobes capabilities` and the gateway's `GET /capabilities` both flag it
`feasible: false`; `/v1/models` omits it; every alias 404s
`role_infeasible`; and `lobes up <dropped-role>` is a user error naming the
shape rather than an opaque compose failure.

## Scope

The rest of the one-lobe-per-box end-state and cross-box referral are out
of scope here — tracked as issue #112 (spec + plan in PR #116); proxy-lobes
are issue #115. `orin-small` (above) ships as declared-but-unvalidated data
only — physical Jetson AGX Orin validation is its own follow-up.

_REALTIME = """\
# lobes realtime audio

An **opt-in fleet overlay** (`lobes init --fleet --audio`) that adds an OpenAI
`/v1/audio/*` facade to the gateway: speech-to-text and text-to-speech behind the
same port as chat. lobes owns this surface (it ships in the wheel as
`lobes.realtime`); it replaces the old separate `realtime-api` sibling stack.

## Topology

```text
client → gateway :8000 → (route /v1/audio/*) → realtime bridge :8080
                                                  ├─ /v1/audio/transcriptions → Parakeet STT :9002
                                                  └─ /v1/audio/speech         → Chatterbox TTS :9000
```

The gateway fans `/v1/audio/*` to the `realtime` bridge container (`AUDIO_URL`,
default `http://realtime:8080`); the bridge proxies each request to the right
sidecar and wraps the response in the OpenAI schema. The bridge's own LLM is the
fleet gateway — no extra vLLM container.

## Backends (both open-weights — no NGC key)

- **STT — Parakeet** (`nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2`, NVIDIA NeMo ASR): the `stt`
  container, `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` (multipart upload → `{"text": ...}`).
  See `lobes explain transcribe` and `docs/parakeet-stt.md`.
- **TTS — Chatterbox** (Resemble AI, 0.5B, Apache-2.0): the `chatterbox` container,
  `POST /v1/audio/speech` (text → 24 kHz audio bytes), zero-shot voice cloning via a
  `.wav` reference. Replaced the retired Magpie NIM. See `lobes explain speak` and
  `docs/chatterbox-tts.md`.

Both backends are **fixed** — they are not in the switchable catalog
(`lobes/catalog.py`), so `lobes switch` does not target them. Swap the STT
checkpoint via `PARAKEET_MODEL` in `.env`; set `DEFAULT_VOICE` for TTS cloning.

## Bring-up

```bash
lobes init --fleet --audio --apply   # scaffold the audio overlay
lobes fleet up --apply               # build + start STT, TTS, and the bridge
lobes fleet status
python3 scripts/audio-smoke.py       # live smoke test (+ TTS→STT round-trip)
```

REST only today (`/v1/audio/transcriptions` + `/v1/audio/speech`); the
`/v1/realtime` WebSocket is planned. The gateway is not yet auth-aware for audio.

_STT = """\
# lobes explain transcribe — speech-to-text (Parakeet)

`POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` — OpenAI/Riva-shaped ASR served by **Parakeet**

`--audio` fleet overlay. Reached through the gateway (default `:8000`); the
container is internal-only on `PARAKEET_PORT` (default 9002).

## Request / response

Multipart `multipart/form-data`: `file` (the audio, required) + `language`
(optional, default `"en"`; Parakeet is English-only). The server reads any format
`soundfile` supports, resamples to 16 kHz mono, and transcribes.

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions -F file=@clip.wav
# → {"text": "the transcribed words"}
```

## Readiness

`GET /v1/health/ready` reports `200 {"status": "ready"}` only when the NeMo model
is loaded AND a trivial CUDA op succeeds; otherwise `503 {"status": "not_ready",
"reason": ...}` (issue #39 — a real readiness check, not liveness). Decision logic:
`lobes/realtime/_readiness.py`.

Fixed backend — not in the switchable catalog; override the checkpoint with
`PARAKEET_MODEL`. See `lobes explain realtime`, `lobes explain speak`, and
`docs/parakeet-stt.md`.

# lobes explain speak — text-to-speech (Chatterbox)

Reached through the gateway (default `:8000`); the container is internal-only on
`CHATTERBOX_PORT` (default 9000). Replaced the retired Magpie NIM — no NGC key.

## Request / response

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech \\

the sidecar → zero-shot **voice cloning** (passed as `audio_prompt_path`). Set a
fleet-wide default with `DEFAULT_VOICE` in `.env`.

The sidecar's own contract is `POST /v1/audio/synthesize` (raw PCM16) +
`GET /v1/health/ready` (`503 {"status":"loading"}` → `200 {"status":"ok"}`); the

## Routing

- **By name** — `model` selects the backend (+ `GATEWAY_ALIASES`); the forwarded
  body's `model` is rewritten to the backend's `--served-model-name`.
- **Default** — missing/unknown `model` → `GATEWAY_DEFAULT_MODEL` (the primary), so
  single-model clients keep working.
- **Failover** — a generate backend that refuses or 5xx's *before any body* is
  retried against the other generate backend (4xx is verbatim; no retry once a 2xx
  body streams). SSE (`"stream": true`) is relayed chunk-by-chunk.
- **Audio** is fanned to the realtime bridge (`AUDIO_URL`).

See `lobes explain gateway` (routing), `lobes explain embeddings|rerank|score`

"""

_ROLES = """\
# lobes explain roles — the six-role Colleague contract

lobes exposes the fleet as SIX first-class, Colleague-facing **roles**
(issue #81) — a caller addresses a *capability*, never a hardcoded model id:

| Role | Backend | Endpoint path |
|---|---|---|
| `cortex` | `primary` (27B MTP) | `/v1/chat/completions` |
| `senses` | `multimodal` (Gemma 4 12B) | `/v1/chat/completions` |
| `embedder` | `embed` (Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B) | `/v1/embeddings` |
| `reranker` | `rerank` (Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B) | `/v1/rerank` (+ `/v1/score`) |
| `stt` | Parakeet (audio overlay, opt-in) | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| `tts` | Chatterbox (audio overlay, opt-in) | `/v1/audio/speech` |

Responsibilities (what each role owns) / forbidden (what it must NOT do):

- `cortex` — reasoning, deciding, planning, tool_use, code_repo_actions,
  validation, final_authority. Forbidden: *(none — final authority)*.
- `senses` — intake, normalize_input, classify_intent,
  prepare_context_packet, speak_back. Forbidden: final_decision,
  repo_action, security_decision.
- `embedder` — vectorization, memory_retrieval_input. Forbidden: *(none)*.
- `reranker` — retrieval_ordering, relevance_refinement. Forbidden: *(none)*.
- `stt` — transcribe, audio_input_to_text. Forbidden: *(none)*.
- `tts` — speech_output, synthesize. Forbidden: *(none)*.

`cortex`/`senses`/`embedder`/`reranker` are always enumerated (present with
`loaded: false` if unwired); `stt`/`tts` need `lobes init --fleet --audio`.
**`brain` is not a valid role** — `cortex` is the only decision authority.

## cortex/senses are layered names, not a rename

`cortex` == the `primary` backend == tier alias `main` (back-compat `hard`).
`senses` == the `multimodal` backend == tier alias `multimodal` (back-compat
`normal`). All four names resolve to the SAME warm backend — no internal
service/container/env var was renamed; this is additive vocabulary.

## Discovery: `lobes capabilities` / `lobes endpoint` / `GET /capabilities`

```bash
lobes capabilities              # human table, all six roles
lobes capabilities --json       # the machine-readable contract
lobes endpoint cortex           # just the base URL for one role
curl -s http://localhost:8000/capabilities   # same contract, over HTTP
```

Both are built by the ONE canonical registry (`lobes.roles.build_role_registry`),
so the CLI and gateway payloads are identical in shape. Each role carries:
`role, model, runtime, endpoint, path, context, quant, mtp, responsibilities,
forbidden_responsibilities, ready, loaded`. All four gateway-fronted roles
share ONE `endpoint` (the gateway) — routing is by the `model` field, not
distinct URLs. An unwired role is never omitted, only `loaded: false`.

## Serving and measuring

- `lobes up <role> [--apply]` — start (or `--down`: stop) ONE role's gear;
  `lobes up colleague-stack --apply` brings up all six (requires the audio
  overlay scaffolded). Dry-run by default.
- `lobes measure [--role <role>] [--json]` — read-only per-role RUNTIME
  metrics (ttft/decode/prefill for cortex/senses; reqs-per-sec/latency for
  embedder/reranker; RTF/latency for stt/tts). Never a correctness claim.
- `lobes benchmark --profile {cortex-only,cortex+senses,senses-direct,
  qwen-nvfp4-vs-bf16,all}` — RUNTIME-ONLY side-by-side comparison across a
  fleet profile.

## Context migration

The legacy single-model scaffold (no fleet) serves `cortex` solo at the full
**256K**. The default fleet duo serves `cortex` at **128K**
(`PRIMARY_MAX_MODEL_LEN=131072`, util 0.30 — util-bound, not context-bound)
and `senses` at **32K** (`MULTIMODAL_MAX_MODEL_LEN=32768`, util 0.14) — an
earlier duo iteration ran the trade-off the other way (`cortex` 64K,
`senses` 128K) before the rebalance. See
`docs/colleague-stack.md#migration-before--after` for the full table.

## Runtime-only, always

Every field here — responsibilities, `lobes measure` metrics, benchmark
profile columns — is a serving/runtime descriptor. **Nothing lobes emits
asserts answer correctness, task quality, or agent-task success** — that
judgment is Colleague's job, not lobes'.

See `docs/colleague-stack.md` (the full contract + client-flow example),
